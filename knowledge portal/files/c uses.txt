C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the operating system. Why use C?
 Mainly because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be:


Operating Systems

Language Compilers

Assemblers

Text Editors

Print Spoolers

Network Drivers

Modern Programs

Data Bases


Language Interpreters

Utilities

In recent years C has been used as a general-purpose language because of its popularity with programmers.
