Considering the fact you know CSS and HTML then Bootstrap is just a 10 hour learning process for you. The col-lg-12 which you are referencing is the Grid System. A web page in Bootstrap is divided into rows and columns(grid). Each row can have the size of 12 columns at max.

So you can have 3 columns in a row like

col-lg-4,col-lg-4,col-lg-4
col-lg-3,col-lg-2,col-lg-7
etc
or 2 columns in a row like

col-lg-6,col-lg-6
col-lg-8,col-lg-4
etc
or 1 column only

col-lg-12
etc
These columns remain on the size of one another i.e they are float:left. But they come down if the screen size becomes smaller i.e. are slacked (float:none).

The slacking is automatically done by bootstrap and this slacking provides your web page with the responsiveness feature.

You can learn How to Use Bootstrap and create Responsive Design very easily. It won’t take more than 10 hours.
