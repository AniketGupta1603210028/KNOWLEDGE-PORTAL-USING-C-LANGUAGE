No, it’s just a front-end framework and although it is very popular, there are other things happening in mobile web design like Adaptive Web Design or RESS which Bootstrap is no solution for.
Bootstrap also has a rather narrow definition of visual design. It’s great as a template to get you started. But for people like myself who already created their own framework it has not enough to offer to create custom designs.
Calling Bootstrap the future of mobile web design is a bit like calling WordPress the future of content management.
