Basically Java can Categories into Three parts:

Java SE (Core Java or Java Core)
Java EE (Advance Java)
Java ME (Mobile Development with Java)

1. What is Core Java?
Java has 3 important Editions
i. Java Standard Edition / Core Java * Old name J2SE.
ii. Java Enterprise Edition / Advanced Java *Old name J2EE.
iii. Java Micro Edition * Old name J2ME.

Core Java" is Sun's term, used to refer to Java SE, the standard edition and a set of related technologies, like the Java VM, CORBA, et cetera. This is mostly to differentiate from, say, Java ME or Java EE.

Core Java" is Oracle's definition and refers to subset of Java SE technologies.

Currently Java Core is defined as a following set:

Basic technologies
CORBA
HotSpot VM
Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
Application monitoring and management
Tools API
XML
But as you probably understand even term 'basic technologies' is somewhat unclear ;-) so this is not so strict definition.
