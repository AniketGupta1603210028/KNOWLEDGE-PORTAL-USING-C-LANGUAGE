no one can predict the future in the technology domain; because things change here every single minute. As a software engineer / developer - you should *not* stick to any specific language; yet master one that you are currently working on. Let me make it very clear : You need to be master of at least one and jack of several! Any programming language is just a set of tools that help you implement logic. If you hone your logic skills; you should be able to get comfortable with any programming language, tool or framework within short time.
