The problem is not that C is difficult to learn. It really isn't any harder to learn than any other programming language, its just that C is so boring to learn. The reason it is suggested to beginners, despite what anyone says, is because it has pointers, so you can learn about the inner workings of computer memory. Other than that, it is tradition. There really are very few good reasons to learn C as a first language.*
