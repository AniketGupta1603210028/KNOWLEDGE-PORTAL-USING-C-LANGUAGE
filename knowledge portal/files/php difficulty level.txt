Well while we all have our own opinions on PHP they are only as good as the coder themselves. Some here will tell you its hard (because they don't understand logic flows, references etc) while others will tell you its easy.

I personally find it pretty straight forward BUT everyone is different. You won't know how hard or easy it is until you try it.
