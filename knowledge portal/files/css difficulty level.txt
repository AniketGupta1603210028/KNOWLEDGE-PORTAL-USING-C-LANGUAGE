CSS is easy to learn and you can get good at it easily.

However, getting good at it at is another story. The two hardest parts of CSS are debugging and browser compatibility, put your focus there. The rest is just a google search away. Practice debugging skills in the dev toolbox (chrome is generally very good for this). Use a tool like Browserstack when you're testing browser compatibility.

Stay ahead of the curve with CSS3 techniques but be sure you know how to deal with legacy browsers.
