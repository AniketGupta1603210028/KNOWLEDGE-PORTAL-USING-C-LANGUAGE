 PHP is superior, mature and old as compared to C# in Web Designing, but C# is much much better than PHP when creating Applications, talking to OS, when speed matters etc. C# does have a very good future like Java. I consider C# as a direct replacement for Java and yes it is. It depends on you in which field you want to work in. If you want to work in Web Designing then go for PHP, but if you are looking for a general purpose language which could do many things then C# is good.
