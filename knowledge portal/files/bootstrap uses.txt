Mobile-first styles are part of the framework
Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera)

2. Bootstrap has a big community and friendly support. 
You can chat with Bootstrappers with IRC in the irc.freenode.net server, in the ##bootstrap channel.
Have a look at what people are doing with Bootstrap at the Bootstrap Expo.

3. Bootstrap is easy to set up and create a working layout in less than an hour
They have a basic template available at http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template and also a set of examples for different needs (http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples). You can just download the bootstrap repository, go to docs/examples folder, copy/paste the example you need and work on it.

7. Their documentation is great!

<div class="visible-xs-block visible-sm-block"></div>
